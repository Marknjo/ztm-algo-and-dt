# JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms By ZTM Academy

This repo contains exercises I do on data structures and algorithms, mostly from ZTM Academy.

## Requirements

You only need VsCode, or any code editor NodeJs to run Vite server.

_PS:_ A quick note, you do not need Vite server/configurations. All you need is a code editor. You can even use browser console to test your code. I just prefer this setup.

_Incase anything just reach out ðŸ˜œ._
